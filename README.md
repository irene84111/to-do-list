# To Do List
This is a simple to-do list using local storage. I made it for a course I tought in NTUST Coding Club in November, 2015.

Special thanks to [Shaumik Daityari] [origin] for building the prototype, I revised some code for my own understanding. However, there are some bugs remain unfixed.

The project use [Bootstrap][bootstrap] as framework and [jQuery][jquery]. Then deployed to [Forge][forge] for [demo][demo].
